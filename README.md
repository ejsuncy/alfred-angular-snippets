# Alfred Angular Snippets
Code Snippets for Angular

This is based on the [Angular Snippets repository](https://github.com/johnpapa/vscode-angular-snippets) created by [John Papa](https://github.com/johnpapa) for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

## Requirements
* [Alfred 3](https://www.alfredapp.com)
* [Alfred 3 Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) (paid upgrade â€” it's worth it!)

## Installation
* Download the [latest release](https://github.com/ejsuncy/alfred-angular-snippets/releases/download/v0.1.0/alfred-angular-snippets-v0.1.0.alfredworkflow) and open it with Alfred

## Updates
* This workflow auto-updates to the latest release by checking the repository once daily.

## Usage
* The keyword for Angular snippets is `ng`
* For example, summon Alfred and type `ng comp`
* Your query following `ng` is matched against the snippet names via Alfred workflow's default `filter` function.
